# Zillow Project
## A look at predicting home values

## Project Description
The housing market is hard to predict, but through data analysis and machine learning models we can make predictions on what a house value might be based on different features of the house. Through this project I will explore the Zillow data for 2017 single-family properties, determine what features are effective in predicting house prices, and create a predictive model for these type of properties.

## Project Goals
* Identify key features that can be used to create an effective predictive model.
* Use regression models to make house price predictions.
* Use findings to make recommendations and establish a foundation for future work to improve model's performance.

## Initial Thoughts
My initial hypothesis is that .

## The Plan
* Aqcuire the data from Codeup mySQL database

* Prepare data

    * 
    * 

* Explore data in search of drivers of churn
    * Answer the following initial question
        * 
        * 

* Develop a model to predict the value of a house
